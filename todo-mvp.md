## Technical Decisions for MVP

### **Simplified Architecture:**
- Skip complex state management (use React state + SWR)
- Minimal UI library (Tailwind + Headless UI)
- Direct Supabase integration (no additional API layer)
- Browser-first approach (PWA later)

### **Deferred Features:**
- Complex animations and 3D backgrounds
- Advanced analytics and charts
- Bulk operations and advanced filtering
- Complex archive system
- Advanced offline capabilities
- Comprehensive testing suite

### **MVP Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (database + auth + edge functions)
- **Voice:** Web Speech API + Whisper fallback
- **AI:** OpenRouter + Claude (already implemented)
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify

## Development Strategy

1. **Start with manual expense entry** - prove the basic concept
2. **Add voice ASAP** - the key differentiator
3. **Focus on core user flow** - capture ‚Üí classify ‚Üí review ‚Üí save
4. **Polish what works** - don't add features until core is solid
5. **Mobile-first approach** - most users will use this on mobile
6. **Authentication last** - let users try it without signup first

This MVP approach gets a working voice-powered expense tracker in users' hands within 2-3 weeks, then iteratively improves it based on real usage feedback.
