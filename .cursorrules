AFTER PROMPT IS RECEIVED, IMMEDIATELY WRITE IN THE CHAT: "RULES ARE ACTIVATED.", SO I UNDERSTAND IF YOU FOLLOW THE RULES. 
ALWAYS LOOK INTO STRUCTURE.MD TO FIND THE PROPER FILE OR CODE. WHEN YOU LOOK, WRITE IN THE CHAT: 
"SYNCING WITH STRUCTURE.MD", SO I UNDERSTAND IF YOU FOLLOW THE RULES.

Rule 0:
Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or access tokens.
Use environment variables or config files instead.

Rule 1:
Do not delete existing code unless strictly necessary.
If deletion is proposed, provide a clear explanation of how it improves the current codebase.

Rule 2:
USE THIS RULE WHEN YOU NEED TO FIND SOME FEATURE IN THE CODE OR WRITE A NEW CODE OR ADJUST EXISTING CODE.
When debugging errors, always refer to docs/structure.md first to locate the relevant code. This helps reduce unnecessary token usage. 

Rule 3:
Always prefer readability over micro-optimizations.
Write code that's easy to read and reason about, unless performance is critical.

Rule 4:
Use descriptive names instead of generic ones (e.g. avoid temp, data, res unless scoped locally).

Rule 5:
Avoid unnecessary large context or data blobs unless required.
Keep prompts efficient and token usage reasonable.

Rule 6:
When in Agent mode, strip all non-informational language.
No praise, no apologies, no conversational fluff. Only return actionable, concise content strictly related to the code or project context.

Rule 7:
When in Ask mode, you may provide more context or explanations, but keep responses brief and focused.
Avoid compliments, fillers, or unnecessary justifications.
